Resource Timing API - resourceTable
===================================

Snippet to lists all resources from the [Resource Timing API](http://www.w3.org/TR/resource-timing/) with load times (inspired by [this article from Steve Souders](http://www.stevesouders.com/blog/2014/08/21/resource-timing-practical-tips/)), in a table in the console.

The table contains the following data:

(*some data* is not always available)
